# Diamond-SHAI_For_AI-project-kaggle

I am very proud to participate in competition "Diamond Price Prediction", it is a part of my Data Science training at SHAI For AI | شاي للذكاء الاصطناعي company and It took second place on more than 45 teams, With score = 0.03028

The project is a "Diamond Price Prediction" where the data contains more than 50 thousand lines for different types of diamonds and 10 main characteristics of each diamond.
Technologies used:
I used the Python language and benefited from many libraries for analyzing data and drawing graphs, such:
pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, missingno
For training, I used several modules such as:
random forest algorithm and GridSearchCV
Project steps:
- Take a look at the data to know more details, using many function.
- Draw graphical relationships between the different parameters
- Get rid of outliers value that are far from the real values, which will negatively affect the module
- Draw the relationships again to ensure that the values are within the correct range
- Encoding the nominal values into a numeric one.
- Choose "RandomForestRegressor" module which gives us the highest accuracy and least uncertainty.
- Enter test data to the module and get the desired result.

The result:

We have a model for which we enter the details of the diamond and get the approximate price for it
